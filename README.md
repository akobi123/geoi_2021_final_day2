# georgian olympiad in informatics 2021 final day 2

## Includes:

statements for problems A B and C in georgian

solutions for problems A B and C in c++

## Short statements in english:

### A winter

**input**: a connected, undirected graph with _N <= 10^5_ nodes and _M <= 2*10^5_ edges

with no self loops or duplicate edges

**output**: number of pairs of nodes such that no matter which edge is removed from the graph a path will still exist between these nodes

### B eksk

**input**: a connected, undirected graph with _N <= 2*10^5_ nodes and N-1 edges and two starting positions U and V

**output**: maximum integer L such that there exists two nonintersecting paths of length L starting from U and V

### C perm11

**input**: a single integer _1 <= N <= 99_

**output**: in a permutation of length N remove all spaces so you get one big number

answer is the amount of such numbers that are divisible by 11

for example if N=3 answer is 2 (only 132 and 231 are divisible by 11)
